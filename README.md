# Project Description

<a id="project-description"></a>
"EasyAssign" is a GUI-enabled web-based application which allows for a seamless and smooth submission and evaluation of projects and assignments between students, TAs, as well as professors. It functions as a sort of collective repository with varied features that can be accessed through a set of three unique user logins. A unified interface is provided that allows both students and faculty to signup and login to the page, after which additional options and facilities are provided corresponding to the appropriate login. Students are provided with the facilities to upload and submit the projects allotted by the faculty, ask doubts regarding concepts and assignments, view project descriptions, and view their allotted TAs. The faculty is provided with the facilities to respond to queries, view and send remarks concerning the submitted projects, allocate groups and TAs, and to evaluate and review the projects effortlessly with due convenience. Our website incorporates a minimalistic design which provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience which does not require prior experience to use. As an added advantage of being a web-based digital platform, it enables a certain flexibility and ease-of-use in project submission and evaluation with the benefit of accessing the service from any device, anywhere.
